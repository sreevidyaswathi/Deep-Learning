# Deep-Learning
Problem Statement:  

For companies like Lending Club correctly predicting whether or not a loan will be a default is very important. In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015, you have to build a deep learning model to predict the chance of default for future loans. As you will see later this dataset is highly imbalanced and includes a lot of features that makes this problem more challenging.

Domain: Finance

Analysis to be done: Perform data preprocessing and build a deep learning prediction model.
